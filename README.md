## Description

This application is used to generate descriptive README files. [readmegenerator](pic.jpg)
       
Purpose: All apps should have a good README file to showcase how the work and how they were developed. This makes that process easy and quick.

The app asks the user a series of questions and compiles a README file from the input.

Technologies Used

* node.js
*  inquirer

Challenges: Formatting and asynchronous methods

Lessons Learned: Using when in the prompt to allow for conditional questions.

Future Development: I would like to break up the code into functions to make the app more developer friendly.

## Installation 
 
User must have node.js installed and then install inquirer

## Credit 
 
Me, myself, and Roman

## Licensing 
 
This is where licensing information would go.
